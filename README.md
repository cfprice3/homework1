First Homework Assignment

For this project the container tags were changed from generic div tags to semantic tags to better describe the content they contained and clean up the overall look for easy reading.

Some classes were changed and taken out to eliminate multiple unnecessary classes with the same styling.

Descriptive alt tags were added to imgs, and a descriptive title to the page.

The margin and padding were changed to the article boxes to match the length of the aside section to make the page itself look cleaner.

An id was added to one of the img in order for the href to work correctly.

Embedded notes were added to html and css to help describe each section and make for easy reading and reference.
